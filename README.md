#### Project History

The proposal initially specified a recommendation service similar to what Spotify and Apple Music already do, that is, recommend music for an individual person. We liked the idea, but thought it was a bit to unoriginal. However, it did contain an idea about recommending music for a group, rather than an individual, and us members decided this to be the most interesting, unique aspect, and thus we chose to focus on it.
